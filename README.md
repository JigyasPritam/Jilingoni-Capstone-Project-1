# Jilingoni-Capstone-Project-1
Capstone project for Jilingoni program. Objective is to design a lightweight, data-driven framework that identifies early behavioral signals of credit card delinquency. The goal is to enable proactive outreach strategies that can reduce “roll-rates” — the progression of customers from one stage of delinquency to the next.
